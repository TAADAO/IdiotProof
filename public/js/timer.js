// Create a countdown function that uses a formula to subtract current date from future date until 
// it equals "0". 

// Include a conditional statement where if the result is 30 days or less, then the data will be moved to the soon to 
//expire field. Then, include a second conditional to start a second function when the result equals zero or less. 

//Second function will be an AJAX call that will access the database, and change warranty status from true to false through the PUT command. 
//Once this is done, run a second AJAX call(?), that implements the DELETE command and removes the data from the warranty database entirely. 

//Implement callback function to enable this.
